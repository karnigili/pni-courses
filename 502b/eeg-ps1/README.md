# NEU 502b Problem Set 2

**Due Monday, April 27 @ 11:59pm**

Complete the exercises in [eeg.ipynb](eeg.ipynb) with your group members. We've also included a notebook ([eeg-ps-inspector.ipynb](eeg-ps-inspector.ipynb)) to aid in inspection of the dataset.

To run the code in this notebook, you'll need to install MNE v0.17.1, command below. The documentation for this version of MNE is [here](https://mne.tools/0.17/documentation.html).
```python
pip install mne==0.17.1
```

## Submission
Commit and push the jupyter notebook to your group's Github repo. Mail cgcorrea@princeton.edu a link to your completed assignment.

## Collaboration Tips
We understand that pair programming is very difficult to implement remotely, but do encourage you to find ways to work together on the assignment. All members of a group should understand all parts of the assignment. One potential collaboration workflow could include programming over a screenshare, periodically swapping which partner is typing by committing and pushing to GitHub so your partner can pull the latest code down.

If using Zoom for collaboration, note that your Princeton credentials should give you access to host a Zoom [here](https://princeton.zoom.us/). On Zoom, it is possible to grant others on the call control of your computer (see [here](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362673-Request-or-Give-Remote-Control) for details.). For groups on sufficiently fast internet, this might be a solution for collaborative programming.
