# NEU 502b Problem Set 1

**Due Wednesday, March 3 @ 2pm**

Complete the exercises in [fmri-ps1-exercises.ipynb](fmri-ps1-exercises.ipynb) with your group members. We expect both of you to contribute to all parts of the assignment and submit separate notebooks.

## Submission
Export your finished Jupyter Notebook as HTML, open the HTML file in a browser, and then save the webpage as a PDF (e.g. using your browser's *Print* functionality). Submit the final PDF via [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/).

## Tips
Computer Science pedagogy often encourages [Pair Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming), where two programmers work at the same computer, taking turns typing & both actively contributing. Here's a [nice summary](http://anh.cs.luc.edu/170/Kindergarten.html) of some tips for how to work together in this kind of setting. Feel free to email Sreejan or Sam if you have questions.
