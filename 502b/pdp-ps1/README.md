# NEU 502b Problem Set 3

**Due Wednesday, May 13 @ 11:59pm**

Complete the exercises in [pdp.ipynb](pdp.ipynb) with your group members.

To run the code in this demo, you'll need to install PyTorch:
```
pip install torch
```

The interface to PyTorch is very similar to that of Numpy with some subtle differences. The [documentation](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/index.html) is very thorough. There are a few cheat sheets online ([showing common operators](https://www.simonwenkel.com/publications/cheatsheets/pdf/cheatsheet_pytorch_numpy_like_functions.pdf), [comparing to numpy](https://github.com/myazdani/numpy-pytorch-cheatsheet)) that might help with getting up to speed on differences.

## Submission
Commit and push the jupyter notebook to your group's Github repo. Mail cgcorrea@princeton.edu a link to your completed assignment.
